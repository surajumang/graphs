/* Writing some questions, will get back to these
* 1) Given an array of characters containing only 3 distinct character A,B,C.
*       You are allowed to perform an operation as many times as you want.
*       In each operation, you will choose an index and change it's index to any character
*       which is greater than the existing character. for eg (A can be replaced by either B or C)
*       The largest character in the string can't be replaced using this criteria
*       The goal is to make all the characters equal using minimum number of operation.*/
